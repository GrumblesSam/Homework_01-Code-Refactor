# Homework_01-Code-Refactor

## Description

With the provided index code and style css, I went back over the html and changed the tags and descriptors to make it more semantic and therefore meeting the accesability requirements. this also required adjustments to some of the css selectors in order to keep the code properly working. In addition, alt text was added to the images so that images were not left blank.

## Changes applied

Changed all div tags into sections to make the website semantic and meet accessability standards.
Added alt descriptions for images that require one.
